Sample notebooks for ODSC West 2020 RAPIDS demos

Users should start with NYCTaxi-Tutorial-Blank.ipynb. If you get stuck, there is a worked version of the xamples in
NYCTaxi-Tutorial-Worked.ipynb.

In a blank notebook in your app.blazingsql.com instance, start by running:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnZed/odsc-west-2020/main/NYCTaxi-Tutorial-Blank.ipynb`

This will download the notebook to your running instance. After it downloads and the UI refreshes (which will take a sec), open
the notebook and begin working through it, filling in code beneat the TODO spots.
