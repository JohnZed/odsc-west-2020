Sample notebooks for ODSC West 2020 RAPIDS demos

Users should start with NYCTaxi-Tutorial-Blank.ipynb. If you get stuck, there is a worked version of the examples in
NYCTaxi-Tutorial-Worked.ipynb.

In a blank notebook in your app.blazingsql.com instance, start by running:

`!git clone  https://github.com/JohnZed/odsc-west-2020.git`

This will download the notebooks to your running instance. After it downloads and the UI refreshes (which will take a sec), open the `NYCTaxi-Tutorial-Blank.ipynb` notebook in the new `odsc-west-2020` folder and begin working through it, filling in code beneath the TODO spots.

Dask (multi-GPU) examples are worked through in the NYCTaxi-Dask.ipynb notebook.
